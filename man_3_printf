	printf - prints the character
SYNOPSIS
	#include "holberton.h"
	int _printf(const char *format, ...);
DESCRIPTION
The printf function creates an output of a character string in
	accordance to a specific format. If the function is successful it will
	return the number of characters printed. The format is a string of
	characters that the function prints. The function goes through each
	character in the string and prints. When a % sign is reached and the
	following character is a special character then a specific conversion
	will occur. The special characters and their conversions are as follows:

	c   prints a character variable
	s   prints a string variable
	d   prints an integer and takes an integer value as a signed decimal integer
	i   prints an integer and takes in a decimal, hexadecimal, or octal type
	b   prints a binary number
	u   prints an unsigned integer
	o   prints an octal number
	x   prints a hexadecimal number
	X   prints a hexadecimal number in caps


RETURN
	The function will return the number of characters printed. If unsuccessful the function will return null.
